# iliasScraper: revised

iliasScraper is as the name already states a web scraper which downloads your
materials from any Ilias course (designed for the university Constance) written in python.

My initial approach can be found here: [MisterXY89/iliasSpider](https://github.com/MisterXY89/iliasSpider).
This time I am not using scrapy but instead simply going for
the old requests+bs4 or with headless selenium.

For password storing I'll be using the keyring package.

## Install

`pip3 install ilias-scraper`
or clone, cd into folder and `pip3 install`.
